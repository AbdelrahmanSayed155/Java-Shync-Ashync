multithreding is executed multi task in the same time 
 is lightWight  and every task have pID 
 
 
 -- multitasking :  alot of process as work in word , mp3 , internet , move mouse , open browser
 
 -- multiprocess : process each one of them have taskings
     one process have it's memory can't any process access
     it , every one have multithreding 
 
 --  multithreading : have tasking have shared memory 
    when i write in libraoffice it fix word correct or not 
    so every process have multithread for execute multitasking
    and allthreads under same process have one pID
    
    threads are very light than process 
    it take altitle memory 
    it save time it execute diff tasks in the same time
    every thread is standalone 
    process is heavy have id  
    swithing between process is cost proc
    becuase it swap memory 
 ----- life Cycle of threading 
 
 ----  multiprocess : mean alot of process work ashynch and every procces have multi tasks
 
 ----- java mult
